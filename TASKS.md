# TASKS.md — Knowledge_Atlas

*Last updated: 2026-03-24 (session 2)*
*Owner repo: `/Users/davidusa/REPOS/Knowledge_Atlas/`*
*This file is the canonical task log for all GUI / frontend work.*

## Repo Assignment Rules (MANDATORY — all AI workers)

| Repo | Purpose | GUI work goes here? |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| `Knowledge_Atlas` | Live GUI · site · frontend | **YES — all new GUI work here** |
| `Article_Eater_PostQuinean_v1_recovery` | Extraction · JSON · EN/BN · summaries · rebuild logic | No |
| `Designing_Experiments` | Course docs · planning · legacy frontend (retiring) | No — migrate to KA |

**Rules:**
1. All new HTML, JS, CSS files go in `Knowledge_Atlas/`. Never in REPOS root or AE recovery.
2. `Designing_Experiments/frontend/` is legacy. Files there are superseded by KA equivalents. Do not add new UI files there.
3. When moving UI assets, record: old path · new path · whether old copy deleted/deprecated.
4. Commit by workstream — GUI commit separate from backend/docs commits.
5. Knowledge_Atlas has no GitHub remote yet. Do NOT attempt `git push` until David creates the remote.

| ID | Task | Added | Context |
|----|------|-------|---------|
| KA-T1 | **Create GitHub remote for Knowledge_Atlas and push** | 2026-03-24 | David must create `github.com/dkirsh/Knowledge_Atlas` first, then: `git remote add origin …` + `git push -u origin master`. CW cannot do this without the remote URL. |
| KA-T2 | **Build GUI evaluation / design agent (Track 4 tool)** | 2026-03-24 | An autonomous agent that inspects KA pages, identifies usability issues against the user-type specs in `ka_gui_assignment.html`, and proposes design changes. Not just a student workbook — an actual AI agent that runs through the site on a scenario, records what it finds, and outputs a structured UX report. Proposed by David 2026-03-24. |

| KA-T2 | **Build GUI evaluation / design agent (Track 4 tool)** | 2026-03-24 | Autonomous agent that navigates KA pages, runs user scenarios, compares actual vs. AI-optimal path, outputs structured UX report (friction, missing affordances, copy issues). |
| KA-T7 | **Create GitHub remote and push AE recovery pending changes** | 2026-03-24 | 30 tracked modified files in AE recovery await push to `origin/codex/recovery-cc-migration-artifacts`. Awaiting David's go-ahead. |

## Session Notes — 2026-03-24

### Repo consolidation completed
All KA UI files now in `Knowledge_Atlas/`. REPOS root is clean. DE legacy frontend moved to `Knowledge_Atlas/Designing_Experiments/` as subdirectory.

### Knowledge_Atlas awaits GitHub remote
Until David creates `github.com/dkirsh/Knowledge_Atlas` and CW runs `git remote add` + `git push`, all work is local-only. Files exist on Mac disk at `/Users/davidusa/REPOS/Knowledge_Atlas/`.

### GUI agent (KA-T2) — design note
The planned GUI agent is distinct from `ka_gui_assignment.html` (a student workbook). The agent would: (1) autonomously navigate KA pages using browser tools; (2) run through defined user scenarios; (3) compare its path against the AI-suggested optimal path; (4) output a structured UX report flagging friction points, missing affordances, and copy issues. This is Track 4's analytical deliverable automated.
