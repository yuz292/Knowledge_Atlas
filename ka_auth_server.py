Knowledge Atlas Lightweight Auth Server
========================================
FastAPI + SQLite backend providing real JWT authentication for ATLAS.

Endpoints
---------
POST /auth/register          – create account (status=pending; instructor approves)
POST /auth/login             – returns access + refresh JWT
POST /auth/forgot-password   – generates reset token (printed to console / stored in DB)
POST /auth/reset-password    – validates token, sets new password
GET  /auth/me                – returns current user info (requires Bearer token)
GET  /api/assignments        – returns student's assigned questions (requires Bearer token)
GET  /api/questions          – list all available research questions
GET  /api/registrations      – instructor-only: pending registrations
POST /api/registrations/{id}/approve   – instructor-only
POST /api/registrations/{id}/reject    – instructor-only

Running
-------
    python3 ka_auth_server.py
    # Server starts on http://localhost:8765
    # CORS allows http://localhost and file:// origins (for local dev)

Notes
-----
- SQLite DB: ka_auth.db (created automatically in same directory as this file)
- JWT secret: auto-generated on first run, stored in ka_auth_secret.txt
- Password reset "email": reset link is printed to console (no SMTP needed for local dev)
- HTTPS: not used in local dev; do not deploy this as-is to a public server
