# Track 3 · Task 1: Collect & Catalog VR-Ready 3D Interior Models

**Track:** VR Studio  
**Points:** 75  
**What you'll have when you're done:** A curated library of ≥ 20 VR-ready 3D interior models in glTF/GLB format, each evaluated against 8 manipulation classes, cataloged in a Google Sheet with viability scores, and accompanied by a mesh annotation file that maps every mesh to its semantic role (ceiling, wall_north, floor, window, etc.).

## The big picture

The Knowledge Atlas stores evidence that specific environmental features alter human cognition and affect. Researchers have manipulated these features experimentally:

| Manipulation Class | Registry tags | What researchers change |
|---|---|---|
| **Geometry** (ceiling height, volume, enclosure) | 46 tags | Ceiling height ≥ 3.0m vs ≤ 2.4m; room proportions; isovist area |
| **Lighting** (intensity, spectrum, direction) | 33 tags | Illuminance (lux); color temperature (2700K–6500K); daylight vs artificial |
| **Materials** (surface texture, roughness) | 13 tags | Wood vs concrete vs glass; natural material ratio; texture density |
| **Color** (hue, warmth, saturation) | 5 tags | Warm vs cool palettes; color diversity; chroma levels |
| **Biophilic elements** (plants, water, nature views) | 6 tags | Plant count; window view content (greenery vs built-up) |
| **Furniture layout** (density, arrangement) | 17 tags | Seating count; sociopetal vs sociofugal arrangement; clutter density |
| **Acoustic properties** | 5 tags | Acoustic privacy; natural sound sources |
| **Visual complexity** (detail, order, fractals) | 22 tags | Fractal dimension; symmetry; ornament density |

To test these relationships in VR, researchers need 3D room models where each factor can be **varied independently while holding others constant**. Your job is to collect models that make this possible.

## What makes a model "VR-ready"

Not every 3D model can be parametrically modified. These are hard constraints:

### Constraint 1: Separable Named Meshes

The ceiling must be a **separate mesh** from the walls. Each wall must be individually identifiable. This rules out:
- ❌ Photogrammetry scans (single fused mesh)
- ❌ "Baked" models (one mesh with texture atlas)
- ✅ Architectural models with separate named objects

**Test:** Open in Blender → check the Outliner. Named objects like "Ceiling", "Wall_North", "Floor" = viable. One object called "mesh_001" = not viable.

### Constraint 2: PBR Materials (not baked textures)

Models must use **PBR material slots** (base color, roughness, metalness), not a single pre-baked lightmap. This enables material swapping.

### Constraint 3: Architectural Scale

Models must be at **real-world scale** (meters). Ceiling height manipulation requires knowing the actual height. VR immersion breaks if scale is wrong.

### Constraint 4: VR-Compatible Polygon Count

For WebXR at ≥ 72 fps: < 500K polygons per scene, < 20 unique materials, textures ≤ 4096×4096.

### Constraint 5: Open License

CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA. No "editorial use only" or "All Rights Reserved."

## Phase 1: Find model sources

> **Contract objective:** "I want a tested, documented list of 3D model sources I can use to collect VR-ready interior models."
> **Contract is with:** 3D model repositories and their APIs.
> **Prompt hint:** *"I need 5+ sources of openly-licensed architectural interior 3D models in glTF/GLB/FBX/OBJ format. For each: license, API availability, format, and whether models have separable meshes. Test one search per source."*

Write YOUR OWN contract. Include Inputs, Processing, Outputs, Success Conditions.

### Starting points

- **Sketchfab** — CC-licensed, API available, downloadable glTF, many architectural interiors
- **3D Warehouse** — SketchUp models with groups/components, export via Blender
- **BlenderKit** — Free tier, natively separable meshes
- **TurboSquid** (free section) — Check license per model
- **Poly Haven** — CC0, excellent HDRIs and some room models
- **CGTrader** (free section) — Mixed quality, check license

**Deliverable:** `model_sources.json`

---

## Phase 2: Collect and evaluate ≥ 20 models

For each model, evaluate it against all 8 manipulation classes. Can you actually change the ceiling? Can you swap the wall material? Can you modify individual walls independently?

### Google Sheet columns (minimum)

| Column | What it records |
|---|---|
| `model_id` | Unique ID (e.g., `SKF_office_001`) |
| `source` / `source_url` | Where you got it |
| `license` | CC0 / CC-BY / CC-BY-SA |
| `room_type` | office / classroom / living_room / etc. |
| `format` | glTF / GLB / FBX (must convert to glTF) |
| `poly_count` | Total polygons |
| `named_meshes` | Yes/No — are architectural elements separate? |
| `pbr_materials` | Yes/No — PBR workflow? |
| `realistic_scale` | Yes/No — meters, not arbitrary? |
| `individual_walls` | Yes/No — can you select and modify each wall independently? |
| `ceiling_modifiable` | Yes/No |
| `lighting_modifiable` | Yes/No — are lights separate objects? |
| `materials_modifiable` | Yes/No |
| `windows_identifiable` | Yes/No — can you find and resize window meshes? |
| `furniture_separable` | Yes/No — is furniture separate from architecture? |
| `viability_score` | 0–8 (count of modifiable classes) |
| `resolution` | Low / Medium / High |
| `naturalness` | 1–5 (visual realism) |
| `notes` | Issues, conversion needed, what's missing |

### Minimum bar

- ≥ 20 models total
- ≥ 10 with viability score ≥ 4
- ≥ 5 different room types
- ≥ 3 different sources

## Phase 3: Create mesh annotation files

For each model, create a `mesh_roles.json` that maps every mesh name to its semantic role. This is what the AI front-end (Task 3) will use to know which mesh to modify.

```json
{
  "model_id": "SKF_office_001",
  "meshes": {
    "Cube.003": { "role": "ceiling", "notes": "single plane, height=3.0m" },
    "Cube.004": { "role": "wall", "wall_id": "north", "notes": "back wall" },
    "Cube.005": { "role": "wall", "wall_id": "south", "notes": "front wall with window cutout" },
    "Cube.006": { "role": "wall", "wall_id": "east" },
    "Cube.007": { "role": "wall", "wall_id": "west" },
    "Plane.001": { "role": "floor" },
    "Cube.010": { "role": "window", "parent_wall": "south", "position": "center" },
    "Cube.011": { "role": "furniture", "subtype": "desk" },
    "Cube.012": { "role": "furniture", "subtype": "chair" },
    "Lamp": { "role": "light", "light_type": "point" }
  },
  "room_dimensions": { "width_m": 6.0, "depth_m": 5.0, "height_m": 3.0 }
}
```

> **Each wall must have a `wall_id`** (north/south/east/west or left/right/back/front). This enables per-wall material and geometry changes.

---

## Phase 4: Write a ruthless validation prompt

Before declaring a model "ready," you must test it with a **ruthless prompt** — an adversarial instruction designed to break things.

### What a ruthless prompt is

A ruthless prompt is an AI instruction that systematically probes every failure mode. Instead of "does it work?", you ask "in exactly which ways does it fail?" The structure:

> *"You are a hostile QA engineer. Your job is to find every way this 3D model catalog entry could be wrong, misleading, or unusable. For model {model_id}:*
> 1. *Open the model in Blender. Count the actual meshes and compare to the mesh_roles.json. Are any missing or mislabeled?*
> 2. *Try to move the ceiling mesh up by 1 meter. Does the room still look correct? Do walls gap?*
> 3. *Try to change the north wall material to a different color. Does only that wall change, or do others change too (shared material)?*
> 4. *Check every material — is it PBR or is it a baked texture that can't be swapped?*
> 5. *Measure the room in Blender. Does it match room_dimensions in the JSON?*
> 6. *Is the model oriented correctly (Y-up or Z-up)? Does the 'north' wall actually face north?*
> *Report every discrepancy found."*

Write a ruthless validation prompt for your catalog. Run it on at least 5 models. Document what broke.

## Reuse

Your model library and mesh annotations are infrastructure. In Task 2, you'll manually test modifications in A-Frame. In Task 3, you'll build the AI front-end that uses your `mesh_roles.json` files to know which mesh to modify. Accurate annotations now save hours of debugging later.
