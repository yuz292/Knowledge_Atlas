# REPOS Root File Relocation Audit

Date: 2026-03-24
Scope:
- loose top-level files in `/Users/davidusa/REPOS`

## Governing rule

Do not move root-level files blindly.
Use this sequence:
1. identify likely owner repo
2. identify whether the file is canonical, duplicate, or archival
3. update references where needed
4. then move or archive

## High-priority root files

## Relocations already completed

Moved into `/Users/davidusa/REPOS/Article_Eater_PostQuinean_v1_recovery/docs/`:

Moved into `/Users/davidusa/REPOS/Designing_Experiments/docs/`:
- `EXPERIMENT_WIZARD_INDEX.txt`
- `WIZARD_SUMMARY.txt`
- `QUICK_START.md`

Moved into `/Users/davidusa/REPOS/Knowledge_Atlas/docs/`:
- `GOOD_IDEAS.md`

Archived out of `/Users/davidusa/REPOS/` root into `/Users/davidusa/REPOS/Backups/root_file_archive_2026-03-24/`:
- `EXPERIMENT_WIZARD_README.md`
- `ENGINEERING_PANEL_AND_SPRINT_PLAN_2026-03-10.md`
- `LAYER_REVISION_PANEL_DELIBERATION_2026-03-10.md`

### 1. `MASTER_DOC_CMR_2026-02-25.md`

Current root path:
- `/Users/davidusa/REPOS/MASTER_DOC_CMR_2026-02-25.md`

Canonical git-backed location:
- `/Users/davidusa/REPOS/Article_Eater_PostQuinean_v1_recovery/docs/MASTER_DOC_CMR_2026-02-25.md`

Disposition:
- treat root copy as non-canonical duplicate
- do not keep two authoritative versions
- later replace root copy with pointer note or archive after reference cleanup

### 2. `ATLAS_COURSE_DESIGN_REVISED_2026-03-17.md`
### 3. `ATLAS_COURSE_SCAFFOLDING_TASKS_2026-03-17.md`

Likely owner repo:
- `Article_Eater_PostQuinean_v1_recovery/docs`

Reason:
- these are course design / scaffolding materials tightly coupled to the recovery-side class infrastructure and handoff docs

Disposition:
- completed: moved into `Article_Eater_PostQuinean_v1_recovery/docs/`

### 4. `ATLAS_THEORETICAL_FOUNDATIONS_EXPANDED_2026-03-17.md`
### 5. `EXPERT_PANEL_MECHANISM_VS_EVIDENCE_2026-03-01.md`
### 6. `Haack_Evidence_Inquiry_Extraction.md`
### 7. `NEURAL_EXPLANATIONS_ENVIRO_PSYCH_PAPER_2026-02-23.md`

Likely owner repo:
- `Article_Eater_PostQuinean_v1_recovery/docs`

Reason:
- these are theory / epistemic / extraction architecture materials

Disposition:
- partially completed:
  - moved: `ATLAS_THEORETICAL_FOUNDATIONS_EXPANDED_2026-03-17.md`
  - moved: `EXPERT_PANEL_MECHANISM_VS_EVIDENCE_2026-03-01.md`
  - moved: `Haack_Evidence_Inquiry_Extraction.md`
  - remaining root-sensitive item: `NEURAL_EXPLANATIONS_ENVIRO_PSYCH_PAPER_2026-02-23.md`

### 8. `CONVERGENT_PIPELINE_PLAN.md`
### 9. `CONSOLIDATED_ACTION_LIST_2026-02-28.md`
### 10. `ENGINEERING_PANEL_AND_SPRINT_PLAN_2026-03-10.md`
### 11. `SPRINT_PLAN_SUMMARY_2026-02-25.md`
### 12. `OVERSEER_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_2026-02-25.md`

Likely owner repo:
- `Article_Eater_PostQuinean_v1_recovery/docs`

Reason:
- these are pipeline / architecture / execution planning files

Disposition:
- partially completed:
  - moved: `CONVERGENT_PIPELINE_PLAN.md`
  - moved: `CONSOLIDATED_ACTION_LIST_2026-02-28.md`
  - moved: `OVERSEER_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_2026-02-25.md`
  - moved: `SPRINT_PLAN_SUMMARY_2026-02-25.md`
  - moved: `PAPER_1_ATLAS_ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE_DRAFT_2026-02-28.md`
  - duplicate root copies of `ENGINEERING_PANEL_AND_SPRINT_PLAN_2026-03-10.md` and `LAYER_REVISION_PANEL_DELIBERATION_2026-03-10.md` have been archived out of the workspace root

### 13. `PORTS_REGISTRY.md`
### 14. `PORTS_COORDINATION_CHECKLIST.md`

Likely owner repo:
- undecided but should not remain loose at root

Best current target:
- `Article_Eater_PostQuinean_v1_recovery/docs` if they remain active system operations docs

Disposition:
- completed: moved into `Article_Eater_PostQuinean_v1_recovery/docs/`

### 15. `SESSION_TRANSFER_DOC_2026-03-20.md`

Likely owner repo:
- `Article_Eater_PostQuinean_v1_recovery/docs`

Reason:
- active coordination / handoff artifact tied to the recovery workspace

Disposition:
- completed: moved into `Article_Eater_PostQuinean_v1_recovery/docs/`

## Files likely to remain local or archival

Examples:
- presentation builders / slide scripts
- proposal documents
- office lockfiles
- stray html/js prototypes at root

Disposition:
- classify into:
  - archival personal docs
  - project-local app files
  - delete later if genuinely dead

## Immediate no-regret policy

Until relocation is executed:
1. do not create new loose docs at `/Users/davidusa/REPOS`
2. use repo-local `docs/` directories only
3. treat the AE recovery Master Doc path as canonical
